The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the `operator` and `operand` lists in parallel, and builds an expression string that represents the algebraic operation. Finally, the function uses the `eval` function to evaluate the expression string and return the result.", "This function takes in an operator and a list of operands and performs an algebraic operation on them.
