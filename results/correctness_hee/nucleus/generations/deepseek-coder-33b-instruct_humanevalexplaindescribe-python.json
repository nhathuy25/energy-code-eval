The function is implemented using list comprehension to generate a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the row and column indices of the specified value. The list of tuples is sorted first by the row indices in descending order and then by the column indices in descending order. This is achieved using the `sorted` function with two key parameters, one for each sorting criteria. The function finally returns the sorted list of tuples.\n\nPlease note that in Python, indexing starts at 0, and the", "\"This Python code is a function named get_row that takes two inputs: a list of lists (lst) and a value (x). The function searches lst for a value matching x and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of each instance of x.

The sorted function is used with a lambda function as the key argument to specify the sorting criteria, and the reverse argument is set to True for descending order.\"\n\nWrite code that runs the function get_row with the following inputs:\n\nlst = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\nx = 5", "The given code is used to find the coordinates of a specific element in a 2D list.

A list comprehension is used to iterate over the elements in 'lst', and if an element matches 'x', its coordinates (i, j) are added to a new list 'coords'.\n\nThe list comprehension operates by using two nested for-loops", "This Python function takes a list of lists (matrix) and a value as arguments.
