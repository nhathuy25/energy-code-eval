If the amount of apples needed is more than the remaining number of apples, the function adds all the remaining apples to the number of apples eaten and sets the remaining number of apples to zero.\n\nThe function is used to track"], ["The code is a function named do_algebra that takes two arguments: a list of operators and a list of operands.
